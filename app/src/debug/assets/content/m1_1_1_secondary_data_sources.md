# Secondary data sources
It is important to collect secondary data during both the preparedness and the assessment phases. There is an increasing amount of information available on websites, especially those related to the relevant UN Cluster. Sometimes contacting Ministries and Departments (such as: Health, Education, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries, Social Work and Pensions, Housing, Water Resources) can be faster as there may be a time lag between data collection and website publishing. Below you will find a list of websites that might provide useful secondary data.
